            <p class="card-grid-paragraph">
                The first Burger Bros hamburger left the grill in August 2021. At the time, two 
                teenage brothers—Tim and Chris Weinhardt—were navigating the challenges of the 
                COVID-19 pandemic. Born, raised and living in Kitchener, Ontario, the two had 
                never experienced anything to the likes of the pandemic. As was the case with most 
                people around the world, their summer was spent in isolation while the country 
                locked down to prevent the spread of infectious disease. While infection rates 
                were rising, so was the boredom in the Weinhardt household. It was a combination 
                of their dwindling motivation and yearning to see family and friends that sparked 
                the beginning of a great idea.
                <br><br>
                The two brothers decided to make free meals for their friends and family. Over 
                the next few weeks, they were hard at work gathering ingredients and arranging 
                deliveries for their friends. What was the goal? To brighten someone else's day. 
                Both Tim and Chris understood the challenging circumstances that the pandemic had 
                put their closest friends in, and they felt that this was a small (but impactful) 
                way that they could make a difference. That summer, the brothers served a total 
                of 7 different families.

                In the following years, Tim and Chris began working on plans to bring Burger 
                Bros to real customers. Up until this point, the entire operation was completely 
                non-profit. The two decided to open their very own food truck and attended local 
                events in Kitchener. Word spread quickly about the small burger restaurant, and 
                online reviews praised the brothers for their high quality food and service. As 
                the opportunity for investments arose, the very first brick and mortar location 
                opened on April 12, 2023, in Guelph, Ontario.
